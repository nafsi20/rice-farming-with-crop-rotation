   abstract = {Agroforestry interventions have the potential to benefit the livelihoods of farmers and communities worldwide. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of agroforestry are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate uncertainty into long-term performance projections for agroforestry interventions in the highlands of Northwest Vietnam. We applied decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches to produce economic ex-ante assessments for seven agroforestry options (intercropping of maize, forage grass, or coffee with tea, nut, fruit, and timber trees) promoted in the region. Our results indicate that farmers likely prefer annual monocultures due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns. However, the results also show that annual profits from monocrops can be expected to decrease over time, due mainly to unsustainable soil use. Agroforestry systems, on the other hand, return substantial profits in the long term, but they also incur high establishment and maintenance costs and can generate net losses in the first few years. Initial financial incentives to compensate for these losses may help in promoting agroforestry adoption in the region. Uncertainties related to farmers’ time preference, crop yields, and crop prices appeared to have the greatest influence on whether monocropping or agroforestry emerged as the preferable option. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers’ optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting agroforestry interventions in Vietnam and elsewhere. Our model produced a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support decision-making under uncertainty. Our innovative research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain outcomes and can be useful for informing similar development interventions in other contexts.},

   abstract = {Indonesia is rated the highest rice consumer and the third-largest producer in the world, consequently, farming is one of the most strategic production systems in the country. Therefore, this study aims to assess the sustainability of rice farming at the provincial level in Indonesia. Furthermore, 32 sustainability indicators, which are categorized into five dimensions, namely economic, ecological, social, technological, and institutional were used. The rapid appraisal approach (Rapsusagri), consisting of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was adopted to assess the sustainability of rice farming. Monte Carlo simulation was used to define the validity and sensitivity analysis to assess the dominant attributes which affect sustainability. The result showed that the economic and social dimensions are at a better level, meanwhile the ecological, technological, and institutional still have various weaknesses and needs improvement. Furthermore, irrigated paddy areas, agricultural infrastructure, rice productivity, use of chemical and organic fertilizers, cropping index, land suitability, village accessibility, officers, and agricultural extension institution were pointed out as the leveraging indicators for sustaining the rice farming system. Also, provinces in Java Island were found to have higher sustainability levels than others. However, it is predicted that this condition will last for a short period due to rapid land conversion, therefore Indonesia needs to consider the development of rice production areas outside Java islands.},

Retail rice prices in Japan are USD 5.20/kg, Saudi Arabia USD 2.30/kg, and in Africa around USD 1.0 / kg, higher than Indonesia. The price of medium rice offered in the world market ranges from USD 0.34 - USD 0.4 per kg, while the price of special rice is USD 1,000/ton or more. Indonesia has the opportunity to export Basmati and aromatic rice to Japan and Saudi Arabia, which purchased at high prices. This export opportunities driven by reciprocal bilateral trade. Rice export to African countries needs to be explore under bilateral trade agreements. Indonesia has chance to export rice if it is able to consistently achieve a production surplus of at least 2 million tons per year. At the stage of exports, the role of the government needed in the form of tax breaks, quality assurance certification and subsidies for the rice production process.},

The agriculture sector faces many problems, including during 2019 it only grew by 3.08% than the previous year, as the second GDP contributor, although it has the potential to reduce unemployment, it has not been supported by adequate human resources and even tends to degeneration due to the lowest income compared to others. Another serious problem is that every year, there is a reduction of between 150,000 to 200,000 hectares of land due to conversion of function for infrastructure development. As an agrarian country, Indonesian farmers' welfare has also not changed much from year to year. Farmers Exchange Rate (NTP) in 2019 was 104.46, only growing 1.25% from the previous year. The low wages of agricultural laborers, limited land ownership, agricultural products' selling price do not benefit the farmers, making their welfare still low. With this phenomenon, Indonesia urgently needs to reform its governance in the agricultural sector, and restore BULOG's role. Strengthening the Bulog's role will be able to maintain food price stability and motivate farmers' interest to continue planting rice and various other food commodities.},

   abstract = {This research was conducted to determine the financial feasibility of growing soybean varieties and their competitiveness in the rice-based cropping system of Indonesia. The research was conducted at two locations in 2020. The results showed that the use of improved varieties of soybean yielded 2.24 t/ha and 2.09 t/ha, which was higher than using local (non-improved) varieties. The use of improved varieties was financially feasible with Revenue Cost (R/C) ratios of 1.88– 1.98 and Benefit Cost (B/C) ratios of 0.88–0.98. The competitiveness of soybeans in Mojokerto and Pasuruan was lower compared to maize and mungbean. Soybean could compete with competing crops if the productivity and price were higher than the current conditions. To be able to compete with maize, the soybean productivity should be 5.14–5.22 t/ha if the current soybean price per kg is IDR 7200 (about US $ 0.51). To compete with mungbean, the soybean productivity should reach 3.05 t/ha with the current price per kg of IDR 7200 (about US $ 0.51). When measured by the price level, to be able to compete with maize, the soybean selling price per kg should be IDR 14,428–IDR 14,893 (about USD 1.06) with a productivity level of 2.24 t/ha.},

In 2020, the figure was about 3.28 million tons, while the domestic production was 0.63 million tons, thus around 81% of the soybean needed was imported. Efforts to increase the domestic soybean production have been conducted since the last decade, which is concerned with increasing the current productivity (1.5 t/ha) through introducing the high-yielding improved varieties and extending the harvested area, particularly to outside of Java. The potential planting area is focused on the irrigated lowland after rice (optimal land) and suboptimal lands (dry, acid, tidal, and shaded lands). The series of the study showed that the yield potential of soybean grown in such lands varied from 1.8 t/ha to 3.0 t/ha. A number of soybeans improved varieties adapted to different land types or agro-ecological conditions also have been released and supported with advanced cultivation technology. The results, challenges, and opportunities to achieve soybean self-sufficiency are discussed in this paper.},
