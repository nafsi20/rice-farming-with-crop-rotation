## Introduction
### Overview

  Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia.Rice is the primary staple food crop with a steady increase in annual production, making Indonesia the third largest rice producer in the world. 93% of Indonesiaâ€™s total number of farmers are small family farms. Rice is the main crop grown and staple food in Southeast Asia. 
  Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.
    - Soybean (Glycine max) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses.
    - Chili (Capsicum annum L.)  is a plant of tropical and subtropical regions  for their fleshy fruits

### Motivation

1. Rice is the primary staple food crop with a steady increase in annual production, making Indonesia the third largest rice producer in the world. 
2. Crop rotation can increase crop yields and income than monoculture of rice and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests and reducing chemical use.
3. Soybean can increase soil fertility and give extra income to farmers.
4. Chili cultivation can improve farmers' income  because of good market price.

### Conception model 

Rice farm with crop rotation. Crop rotation for this project is chilli ana soybean. Total cost per crop are consists of labor, seeds, pesticides, fertilizer, machinery and rent land. Moreover, Revenues is yield of rice, soybean and chilli. Finally, total cost, revenues and discount rate use put to calculate to Net Present Value(NVP).

## Conclusion

1. Our project has proven that selecting the appropriate crop rotation between rice, soybean, and chili to produce the best profits is crucial for achieving optimal results.
2. The decision to rotate crops between rice and chili is still applicable with slightly smaller profits.
3. Crop rotation between rice, soybeans, and rice is less efficient than other options with respect to profit and sustainability.


## Recommendtion

It is highly recommended for Indonesian smallholder farmers to implement three crop rotations (rice, soybean, and chili) as it is more suitable for sustainable development.

## What have we learned from this project?

 Crop rotation is crucial for maintaining the soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties, as well as for improving crop yields and farmers' income.
