# Introduction

Rice is the primary staple food crop with a steady increase in annual production, making Indonesia the third largest rice producer in the world. 93% of Indonesiaâ€™s total number of farmers are small family farms.

# Motivation

Crop rotation can increase crop yields and income than monoculture of rice and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests and reducing chemical use. Soybean can increase soil fertility and give extra income to farmers. Chili cultivation can improve farmers' income.

# Conception model 

Rice farm with crop rotation. Crop rotation for this project is chilli ana soybean. Total cost per crop are consists of labor, seeds, pesticides, fertilizer, machinery and rent land. Moreover, Revenues is yield of rice, soybean and chilli. Finally, total cost, revenues and discount rate use put to calculate to Net Present Value(NVP).
